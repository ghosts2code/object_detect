# object_detect
this script make use of predefined weights of YOLO and apply the model to the ongoing camera module. (you need to specify the cameraID and path to those weights)
to get the predefined weights you can download it from typing in terminal 'wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights'
Huge thanks to Arun Ponnuswamy, I learnt and use functions from his repo to create this. check out his documentation from 'https://towardsdatascience.com/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv-and-python-21e50ac599e9', this will provide you better insights what is happening in most of the code.
